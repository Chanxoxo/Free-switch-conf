Minimal FreeSWITCH configuration
================================

This is a minimalistic FreeSWITCH configuration. It does nothing, yet it
allows starting the FreeSWITCH daemon and connecting to its console with
fs_cli.

The purpose of this configuration is to provide a base for new projects,
so that you don't have to clean up the vanilla configuration from
unneeded features.

Tested on Debian with packages from [http://files.freeswitch.org],
FreeSWITCH version 1.2.13 (it should work also with any other FreeSWITCH
version).


Usage:

cd /etc
git clone https://github.com/xlab1/freeswitch_conf_minimal.git freeswitch

Further on, you may want to set up your own project-specific Git
repository and push new changes to it.

The following files are empty and are placed there to keep the
FreeSWITCH XML preprocessor happy. Feel free to delete them after
placing your own XML files:

ivr_menus/stub.xml
sip_profiles/external/stub.xml
directory/stub.xml
lang/en/ivr/stub.xml


The SIP profiles are modified to allow multiple domains, as described in
http://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Multi-tenant
